1. The program draws a wheel and a betting board with all the betting options.

2. The user starts the game with a total betting purse of $100.

3. The user can bet $5, $10 and $25. Each of these amounts are respectively represented by  a yellow, blue, and black chip.

4. To play: The user drags a chip onto the board to place a bet, and then click the PLAY button.

5. To replay: The user clicks the RESET button, drags a chip onto the board to place a bet, and then click the PLAY button.

6. At each turn, the program prints the winning number, whether or not the user won, and the payout.

7. The game will quit running if the user types 'Exit' or if the betting purse equals zero.
