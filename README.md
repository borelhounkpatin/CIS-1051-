Projects
Buil a roulette wheel game.
1. The game will prompt the user for the total betting purse.
2. The game will display all the betting options.
3. At each turn, the game will prompt the user for the bet's amount for the current turn. This amount is less or equal to the total betting purse
plus all the winning from the previous turns minus all the losses.
4. At each turn,prompt the user on if he want to keep play.
5. The game will quit running if the betting purse equals zero.
I am doing this project with Kyle Rowe. Our assigned TA is Joanne Nichols.
